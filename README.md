# Johandry's Blog ([blog.johandry.com](http://blog.johandry.com))

This is the source code and content of my blog. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a great framework to build static web sites.

Everything here is automated in a Makefile, so most of the required actions are done with `make`, but everything else is documented here.

The main requirement for this blog is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), install it executing: `brew install hugo`.

## New Post

To create a new post:
1. Execute `hugo new post/<title-file>.md`
2. Edit the file `content/post/a-new-blog-on-github.md` to add the post content.
3. Edit the metadata and make sure to remove the `draft` variable when you are happy with the content

## Initial process

Everything I did to create this blog is documented in my second post: [A New Blog on GitHub](http://blog.johandry.com/post/a-new-blog-on-github/).
