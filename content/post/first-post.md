Is it?

Nah! I think this is my 3rd attempt to start a blog. I started with [johandry.blogspot.com](http://johandry.blogspot.com) then I started a cool project with [PerlDancer](http://perldancer.org) and created this other blog [perlondancer.blogspot.com](http://perlondancer.blogspot.com). Also, there were a couple of failed attempts with WordPress.com.

I'll continue posting, I have some ideas and projects that I have in my [Github](https://github.com/johandry). Most of them related to Go and DevOps.

Stay tuned!
