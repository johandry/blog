# Ideas to do or complete and post

Here are some ideas for blog posts about projects that I've done or incubating.

- [ ] Ansible Callback: (WIP, branch: `post/ansible_callback`) this is a Go code to receive the output from one or multiple Ansible process running on different systems.
- [X] Simple Kubernetes Client: (WIP, branch: `post/k8s_client`) here I explain how to use make a Kubernetes client using `kubernetes.Clientset` if you know the resource kind, but also here is a client that applies any resource without knowing the kind.
- [ ] How to use Terraform packages: (WIP, branch: `post/using-terraform-packages-from-go`) this is kind of the second part for the post about Terranova, in this post I explain how to use the Terraform code without Terranova. This may be outdated due to the latest Terraform version (0.12).
- [ ] Microservices in Go: gRPC: (WIP, branch: `post/microservices_in_go_grpc`) this is the 2nd part of Microservices in Go, this time using gRPC.
- [ ] SPA Viewer: This is a Go package to expose a Single Page Application made in Angular, React, Vue or any other JS framework. The result is a single binary made in Go that can run on any platform exposing this SPA and also opening a window or application with this app. The package is working but not published to github yet.
- [ ] Improve/update my personal website www.johandry.com
